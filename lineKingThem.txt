there is a calm surrender to the rush of the day
when the heat of rolling wind can be turned away
an enchanted moment, and it sees me through
it enough for the restless warrior, just to be with you
and can you feel the love tonight, it is where we are 
it enough for this wide-eyed wonderer
that we got this far.
and can you feel the love tonight
how it laid to rest
it enough to make kings and vagabonds Believe the very best.

there is time for everyone if they only learn.
that twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn.
there is a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
when the heart of the star crossed voyager, beats in time with yours. 
and can you feel the love tonight, it is where we are?
it's enough for this wide-eyed wonderer, that we got this far.
and can you feel the love tonight,
how it's laid to rest?
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best.
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds 
Believe the very best.
